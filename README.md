## 🛠️ How I Use This Repo

### With Claude Code (Terminal)
```bash
# Open the repo and start a session
cd leetcode-mastery
claude

# Then ask:
# "Help me solve Two Sum"
# "Explain the sliding window pattern"
# "Review my solution for 3Sum"
```

### With Claude.ai (Web)
1. Use my dedicated "LeetCode Mastery" project
2. Paste problems and work through them interactively
3. Copy final solutions to this repo
